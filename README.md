This project is part of my journey to learn Java and software testing. It includes several basic components such as contacts, appointments, and tasks management systems. Each component is designed to practice CRUD operations and understand how to structure Java applications.

Components
Contact Management: Handles creating, reading, updating, and deleting contact details.
Appointment Management: Manages scheduling and maintaining records of appointments.
Task Management: Allows for adding, updating, and removing tasks.
Testing
Each component has corresponding unit tests to ensure functionality works as expected:

ContactTest and ContactServiceTest: Tests for the Contact and ContactService classes.
AppointmentTest and AppointmentServiceTest: Tests for the Appointment and AppointmentService classes.
TaskTest and TaskServiceTest: Tests for the Task and TaskService classes.

Reflection
How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure functionality, I implemented rigorous unit testing for each component. These tests covered edge cases and verified the integrity of CRUD operations. Security was considered by validating all inputs and ensuring that operations, such as updating or deleting, required the correct identifiers. Implementing testing at every step allowed me to catch issues early and improve the reliability of the software.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Understanding user needs started by breaking down each component (contacts, appointments, tasks) into essential features that a user would expect. By focusing on clear use cases such as "schedule an appointment" or "update a task," I could design each feature with the user's perspective in mind. Future improvements may involve adding a user interface or connecting the system to a database for persistence.

How do I approach designing software?
I followed a modular approach by dividing the system into distinct components for contacts, appointments, and tasks. Each component was built with a clear separation of concerns, ensuring that data models and services were independent but cohesive. By focusing on reusability and scalability, I designed the project to accommodate future enhancements, such as adding a graphical user interface or integrating external APIs.

Conclusion
This project helped me deepen my understanding of Java, CRUD operations, and software testing practices. Reflecting on the work allowed me to solidify my learning and gain a better appreciation for structured programming and test-driven development. As I continue to improve, I aim to incorporate more advanced features and expand the projectâ€™s scope.
