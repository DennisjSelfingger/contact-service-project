This project is part of my journey to learn Java and software testing. It includes several basic components such as contacts, appointments, and tasks management systems. Each component is designed to practice CRUD operations and understand how to structure Java applications.

Components
Contact Management: Handles creating, reading, updating, and deleting contact details.
Appointment Management: Manages scheduling and maintaining records of appointments.
Task Management: Allows for adding, updating, and removing tasks.
Testing
Each component has corresponding unit tests to ensure functionality works as expected:

ContactTest and ContactServiceTest: Tests for the Contact and ContactService classes.
AppointmentTest and AppointmentServiceTest: Tests for the Appointment and AppointmentService classes.
TaskTest and TaskServiceTest: Tests for the Task and TaskService classes.
